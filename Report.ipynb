It's sometimes google translate. Sometimes you will be able to see copying from previous labs, it's because this course is not as easy as I thought in the beginnig, and I don't have experience in computer science. I hope you will find at this page full project, 1 and 2 week. So, let's do this!"

More specifically, four overlooked cracks suggest that the London market may be in worse shape than many realize: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder exodus and tax hikes addressing overseas buyers of homes in England and Wales."
